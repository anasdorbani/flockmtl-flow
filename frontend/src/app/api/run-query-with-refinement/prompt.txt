Given the following SQL query, generate a detailed JSON representation of its physical execution plan. The execution plan should follow this structure:

```json
{
  "name": "Operator name",
  "description": "Brief explanation of the operator's purpose",
  "params": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2",
    ...
  },
  "children": [
    {
      "name": "Child operator name",
      "description": "Brief explanation of the child operator's purpose",
      "params": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
        ...
      },
      "children": [...]
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

The **root operator** should be the **sink**, which is the final operator that materializes the result of the query. Each operator in the execution plan should have the following attributes:

- **name**: The name of the operator (e.g., `Scan`, `Projection`, etc.).
- **description**: A brief explanation of what the operator does.
- **params**: The parameters the operator works with (e.g., the columns it accesses, function parameters, etc.).
- **children**: The operators that are processed before this operator (if any).

The flow of data should go from the initial scan of the table through intermediate operators and end in the final materialization of the result.

Here is the SQL query you should analyze:

```sql
SELECT id, title, abstract, content, 
       llm_complete( {'model_name': 'gpt-4o', 'secret_name': 'high_rate'}, 
                     {
                       'prompt': 'Analyze the following research paper details and extract the global theme in a concise few words.',
                       'context_columns': [
                         {'data': title, 'name': 'title'},
                         {'data': abstract, 'name': 'abstract'}, 
                         {'data': content, 'name': 'content'}
                       ]
                     } ) AS theme 
FROM research_paper
```

Please provide the physical execution plan in the specified JSON format.
